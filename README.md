The UML chatbot facilitates conversations with students by providing personalized and context-aware responses to their queries. 
By using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, the chatbot efficiently retrieves relevant information and generates accurate, helpful responses. 
For instance, a student can inquire about course details, deadlines, or even administrative procedures, and the chatbot will seamlessly pull information from integrated databases 
like ChromaDB or MongoDB. Additionally, the chatbot can assist students in creating Salesforce cases directly within the chat, streamlining support requests and 
improving overall user experience.
